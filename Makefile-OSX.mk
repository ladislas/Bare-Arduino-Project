### PROJECT_DIR
### This is the path to where you have created/cloned your project
PROJECT_DIR       = /Users/{{ YOUR USERNAME }}/path/to/MyAwesomeProject

### AVR_GCC_VERSION
### Check if the version is equal or higher than 4.9
AVR_GCC_VERSION  := $(shell expr `avr-gcc -dumpversion | cut -f1` \>= 4.9)

### ARDMK_DIR
### Path to the Arduino-Makefile directory.
ARDMK_DIR         = $(PROJECT_DIR)/Arduino-Makefile

### ARDUINO_DIR
### Path to the Arduino application and ressources directory.
### for Arduino IDE 1.0.x
# ARDUINO_DIR       = /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java
### for Arduino IDE 1.6.x
ARDUINO_DIR       = /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java

### USER_LIB_PATH
### Path to where the your project's libraries are stored.
USER_LIB_PATH     :=  $(realpath $(PROJECT_DIR)/lib)

### BOARD_TAG & BOARD_SUB
### It must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e uno, mega, etc.)
### For the Arduino Uno, only BOARD_TAG is mandatory and BOARD_SUB can be equal to anything
### For the Arduino Mega2560, BOARD_SUB is also needed
BOARD_TAG         = mega
BOARD_SUB         = atmega2560

### MONITOR_BAUDRATE
### It must be set to Serial baudrate value you are using.
MONITOR_BAUDRATE  = 115200

### AVR_TOOLS_DIR
### Path to the AVR tools directory such as avr-gcc, avr-g++, etc.
AVR_TOOLS_DIR     = /usr/local

### AVRDDUDE
### Path to avrdude directory.
AVRDDUDE          = /usr/local/bin/avrdude

### CXXFLAGS_STD
CXXFLAGS_STD      = -std=gnu++11

### CPPFLAGS
### Flags you might want to set for debugging purpose. Comment to stop.
CXXFLAGS         = -pedantic -Wall -Wextra

### If avr-gcc -v is higher than 4.9, activate coloring of the output
ifeq "$(AVR_GCC_VERSION)" "1"
    CXXFLAGS += -fdiagnostics-color
endif

### MONITOR_PORT
### The port your board is connected to. Using an '*' tries all the ports and finds the right one.
MONITOR_PORT      = /dev/tty.usbmodem*

### OBJDIR
### This is were you put the binaries you just compile using 'make'
CURRENT_DIR       = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))
OBJDIR            = $(PROJECT_DIR)/bin/$(CURRENT_DIR)/$(BOARD_TAG)

### path to Arduino.mk, inside the ARDMK_DIR, don't touch.
